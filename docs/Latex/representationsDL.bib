Since incoherent quantum tunneling is employed by quantum annealers (QAs) to solve optimization problems, this result suggests there is no quantum advantage in using QAs w.r.t. quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. A counterexample is the recently introduced shamrock model, where topological obstructions cause an exponential slowdown of the PIMC tunneling dynamics with respect to incoherent quantum tunneling, leaving the door open for potential quantum speedup, even for stoquastic models. In this work, we investigate the tunneling time of projective QMC simulations based on the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) algorithm without guiding functions, showing that it scales as \$1/{\textbackslash}Delta\$, i.e., even more favorably than the incoherent quantum-tunneling time, both in a simple ferromagnetic system and in the more challenging shamrock model. However a careful comparison between the DMC ground-state energies and the exact solution available for the transverse-field Ising chain points at an exponential scaling of the computational cost required to keep a fixed relative error as the system size increases.},

	abstract = {We investigate the use of variational wave-functions that mimic stochastic recurrent neural networks, specifically, unrestricted Boltzmann machines, as guiding functions in projective quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) simulations of quantum spin models. As a preliminary step, we investigate the accuracy of such unrestricted neural network states as variational Ans{\textbackslash}"atze for the ground state of the ferromagnetic quantum Ising chain. We find that by optimizing just three variational parameters, independently on the system size, accurate ground-state energies are obtained, comparable to those previously obtained using restricted Boltzmann machines with few variational parameters per spin. Chiefly, we show that if one uses optimized unrestricted neural network states as guiding functions for importance sampling the efficiency of the PQMC algorithms is greatly enhanced, drastically reducing the most relevant systematic bias, namely that due to the finite random-walker population. The scaling of the computational cost with the system size changes from the exponential scaling characteristic of PQMC simulations performed without importance sampling, to a polynomial scaling, even at the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The important role of the protocol chosen to sample hidden-spins configurations, in particular at the critical point, is analyzed. We discuss the implications of these findings for what concerns the problem of simulating adiabatic quantum optimization using stochastic algorithms on classical computers.},

	abstract = {Gate model quantum computers with too many qubits to be simulated by available classical computers are about to arrive. We present a strategy for programming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means that the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the device. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by unitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational problems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a Hamiltonian. These problems may not fit naturally on the physical layout of the qubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on the qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters. Measurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new parameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the energy). As an example we consider finding approximate solutions to MaxCut on 3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a rectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at least 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5). We open up the algorithm to have different parameters for each single qubit \$X\$ rotation and for each \$ZZ\$ interaction associated with the nearest neighbor interactions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an enveloping classical algorithm can be used to find the parameters which sit on the grid to optimize an objective function with a different connectivity. We discuss strategies for finding good parameters but offer no evidence yet that the proposed approach can beat the best classical algorithms. Ultimately the strength of this approach will be determined by running on actual hardware.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03489},
	abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation, and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of quantum computing applications. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.'s Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost-function-based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, is the consideration of general parametrized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time-evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. Here, we introduce the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide brief descriptions of mappings for diverse problems.},

In our algorithm, the problem Hamiltonian (oracle) and a transverse field are applied alternately to the system in a periodic manner. We introduce a technique, based on spin-coherent states, to analyze the composite unitary in a single period. This composite unitary drives a closed transition between two states that have high degrees of overlap with the initial state and the target state, respectively. The transition rate in our algorithm is of order Θ(1/√N), and the overlaps are of order Θ(1), yielding a nearly optimal query complexity of T≃√N(π/2√2). Our algorithm is a QAOA circuit that demonstrates a quantum advantage with a large number of iterations that is not derived from Trotterization of an adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) algorithm. It also suggests that the analysis required to understand QAOA circuits involves a very different process from estimating the energy gap of a Hamiltonian in AQO.},

Varying the proportionality factor a and the initial state only changes the cross-over behavior into the asymptotic large- L behavior. In some cases, choosing an optimal factor a may also lead to the vanishing of the leading finite-size corrections. The observation of typicality can be used to speed up simulations of quantum criticality, not only within the Monte Carlo approach but also with other numerical methods where imaginary-time evolution is employed, e.g., tensor network states, as it is not necessary to evolve fully to the ground state but only for sufficiently long times to reach the typicality regime.},

We therefore conclude that a recent proposal for dealing with the sign problem due to Sorella et al. Leads to an uncontrolled approximation. In the cases we have studied it is a good approximation for the ground-state energy, and we present a method for calculating the correction needed to make it exact.

We explain the relation between finite temperature quantum field theory in (d,1) dimensions and statistical classical field theory in d+1 dimensions. This identification allows to analyze the finite temperature QFT in terms of the renormalization group and the theory of finite size effects of the classical theory. We discuss in particular the limit of high temperature (HT) or the situation of finite temperature phase transitions. There the concept of dimensional reduction plays an essential role. Dimensional reduction in some sense reflects the known property that quantum effects are not important at high temperature. We illustrate these ideas with several standard examples, phi{\textasciicircum}4 field theory, the non-linear sigma model and the Gross-Neveu model, gauge theories. We construct the corresponding effective reduced theories at one-loop order, using the technique of mode expansion of fields in the imaginary time variable. In models where the field is a vector with N components, the large N expansion provides another specially convenient tool to study dimensional reduction.},

In contrast to previous studies, in which a functional form for h(x,y) was assumed, we here optimize all the amplitudes for lattices with up to 32×32 spins. We use two different schemes for optimizing the amplitudes; a Newton conjugate-gradient method and a stochastic method which requires only the signs of the first derivatives of the energy. The latter method performs significantly better. The energy for large systems deviates by only ≈0.06\% from its exact value (calculated using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations). The spin correlations are also well reproduced, falling ≈2\% below the exact ones at long distances (corresponding to an ≈1\% underestimation of the sublattice magnetization).

	abstract = {One of the main quests of many-body physics and quantum information is to understand various quantum phases and in particular the entanglement present in them. In this work we have uncovered a unique, physically transparent quantum phase transition in a spin chain where entanglement entropy itself jumps from low scaling, most typical for gapped models and short-range correlations, to a critical phase where the scaling exhibits an extraordinary amount of entanglement. This discovery pushes the boundaries of a possible range of nonlocal quantum correlations displayed by local Hamiltonians and opens a door to fundamental and practical questions about the interplay of entanglement and locality in many-body systems., The nature of entanglement in many-body systems is a focus of intense research with the observation that entanglement holds interesting information about quantum correlations in large systems and their relation to phase transitions. In particular, it is well known that although generic, many-body states have large, extensive entropy, ground states of reasonable local Hamiltonians carry much smaller entropy, often associated with the boundary length through the so-called area law. Here we introduce a continuous family of frustration-free Hamiltonians with exactly solvable ground states and uncover a remarkable quantum phase transition whereby the entanglement scaling changes from area law into extensively large entropy. This transition shows that entanglement in many-body systems may be enhanced under special circumstances with a potential for generating “useful” entanglement for the purpose of quantum computing and that the full implications of locality and its restrictions on possible ground states may hold further surprises.},

	abstract = {Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science. Ground states of quantum many-body systems with local interactions typically obey an “area law” which means that the entanglement entropy is proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional when the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated by at most a logarithm over two decades. Recent discovery of Motzkin and Fredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant violation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of the volume in spite of local interactions. In this paper, we first analytically compute the Rényi entropy of the Motzkin and Fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The Rényi entropy is an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is reconstructed once the Rényi entropy is known as a function of its parameter. We find nonanalytic behavior of the Rényi entropy with respect to the parameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin chain studied so far. Interestingly, similar behavior is seen in the Rényi entropy of Rokhsar–Kivelson states in two dimensions.},

Using the detailed balance rules for directed loops, we show that it is possible to smoothly connect generally applicable simulation schemes (in which it is necessary to include back-tracking processes in the loop construction) to more restricted loop algorithms that can be constructed only for a limited range of Hamiltonians (where back-tracking can be avoided). The "algorithmic discontinuities" between general and special points (or regions) in parameter space can hence be eliminated. As a specific example, we consider the anisotropic S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field. We show that directed loop simulations are very efficient for the full range of magnetic fields (zero to the saturation point) and anisotropies. In particular for weak fields and anisotropies, the autocorrelations are significantly reduced relative to those of previous approaches. The back-tracking probability vanishes continuously as the isotropic Heisenberg point is approached. For the XY-model, we show that back-tracking can be avoided for all fields extending up to the saturation field. The method is hence particularly efficient in this case. We use directed loop simulations to study the magnetization process in the 2D Heisenberg model at very low temperatures. For LxL lattices with L up to 64, we utilize the step-structure in the magnetization curve to extract gaps between different spin sectors. Finite-size scaling of the gaps gives an accurate estimate of the transverse susceptibility in the thermodynamic limit: chi\_perp = 0.0659 +- 0.0002.},

It reminds us of the basic renormalization group (RG) concept in statistical physics. In order to explore possible relations between DNN and RG, we use the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) applied to an Ising model and construct a flow of model parameters (in particular, temperature) generated by the RBM. We show that the unsupervised RBM trained by spin configurations at various temperatures from T=0 to T=6 generates a flow along which the temperature approaches the critical value Tc=2.27. This behavior is the opposite of the typical RG flow of the Ising model. By analyzing various properties of the weight matrices of the trained RBM, we discuss why it flows towards Tc and how the RBM learns to extract features of spin configurations.},

	abstract = {A major bottleneck in the quest for scalable many-body quantum technologies is the difficulty in benchmarking their preparations, which suffer from an exponential `curse of dimensionality' inherent to their quantum states. We present an experimentally friendly method for density matrix reconstruction based on deep neural-network generative models. The learning procedure comes with a built-in approximate certificate of the reconstruction and makes no assumptions on the state under scrutiny, making it both reliable and unconditional. It can efficiently handle a broad class of complex systems including prototypical states in quantum information, as well as ground states of local spin models common to condensed matter physics. The key insight is to reduce the state tomography task to an unsupervised learning problem of the statistics of an informationally complete set of quantum measurements. This constitutes a modern machine learning approach to the validation of large quantum devices, which may prove relevant as a neural-network ansatz over mixed states suitable for variational optimization.},

A central question is whether neural networks can provide a tractable representation of a given quantum state of interest. When true, stochastic neural networks can be employed for many unsupervised tasks, including generative modeling and state tomography. However, to be applicable for real experiments, such methods must be able to encode quantum mixed states. Here, we parametrize a density matrix based on a restricted Boltzmann machine that is capable of purifying a mixed state through auxiliary degrees of freedom embedded in the latent space of its hidden units. We implement the algorithm numerically and use it to perform tomography on some typical states of entangled photons, achieving fidelities competitive with standard techniques.},

In conjunction with variational Monte Carlo calculations, this ansatz has been applied to find Hamiltonian ground states and their energies. Here, we provide extensions of this method to study excited states, a central task in several many-body quantum calculations. First, we give a prescription that allows us to target eigenstates of a (nonlocal) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Second, we give an algorithm to compute low-lying excited states without symmetries. We demonstrate our approach with both restricted Boltzmann machines and feed-forward neural networks. Results are shown for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, and for the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. When comparing to exact results, we obtain good agreement for a large range of excited-states energies. Interestingly, we find that deep networks typically outperform shallow architectures for high-energy states.},

However, heuristic classical approaches are often very efficient in approximately simulating special circuit structures, for example with limited entanglement, or based on one-dimensional geometries. Here we introduce a classical approach to the simulation of general quantum circuits based on neural-network quantum states (NQS) representations. Considering a set of universal quantum gates, we derive rules for exactly applying single-qubit and two-qubit Z rotations to NQS, whereas we provide a learning scheme to approximate the action of Hadamard gates. Results are shown for the Hadamard and Fourier transform of entangled initial states for systems sizes and total circuit depths exceeding what can be currently simulated with state-of-the-art brute-force techniques. The overall accuracy obtained by the neural-network states based on Restricted Boltzmann machines is satisfactory, and offers a classical route to simulating highly-entangled circuits. In the test cases considered, we find that our classical simulations are comparable to quantum simulations affected by an incoherent noise level in the hardware of about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ per gate.},

It is based on the deep Boltzmann machine architecture, in which two layers of hidden neurons mediate quantum correlations among physical degrees of freedom in the visible layer. The approach reproduces the exact imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolution, and is completely deterministic. In turn, compact and exact network representations for the ground states are obtained without stochastic optimization of the network parameters. The number of neurons grows linearly with the system size and total imaginary time, respectively. Physical quantities can be measured by sampling configurations of both physical and neuron degrees of freedom. We provide specific examples for the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg models by implementing efficient sampling. As a compact, classical representation for many-body quantum systems, our approach is an alternative to the standard path integral, and it is potentially useful also to systematically improve on numerical approaches based on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture.},

These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.},

Through unsupervised learning, we train the Boltzmann machine on data sets constructed with spin configurations importance sampled from the partition function of an Ising Hamiltonian at different temperatures using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to generate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those computed by direct MC sampling. We demonstrate that the Boltzmann machine can faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. Further, we observe that the number of neurons required to obtain accurate results increases as the system is brought close to criticality.},

	abstract = {Neural-network quantum states have recently been introduced as an Ansatz for describing the wave function of quantum many-body systems. We show that there are strong connections between neural-network quantum states in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and some classes of tensor-network states in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that short-range restricted Boltzmann machines are entangled plaquette states, while fully connected restricted Boltzmann machines are string-bond states with a nonlocal geometry and low bond dimension. These results shed light on the underlying architecture of restricted Boltzmann machines and their efficiency at representing many-body quantum states. String-bond states also provide a generic way of enhancing the power of neural-network quantum states and a natural generalization to systems with larger local Hilbert space. We compare the advantages and drawbacks of these different classes of states and present a method to combine them together. This allows us to benefit from both the entanglement structure of tensor networks and the efficiency of neural-network quantum states into a single Ansatz capable of targeting the wave function of strongly correlated systems. While it remains a challenge to describe states with chiral topological order using traditional tensor networks, we show that, because of their nonlocal geometry, neural-network quantum states and their string-bond-state extension can describe a lattice fractional quantum Hall state exactly. In addition, we provide numerical evidence that neural-network quantum states can approximate a chiral spin liquid with better accuracy than entangled plaquette states and local string-bond states. Our results demonstrate the efficiency of neural networks to describe complex quantum wave functions and pave the way towards the use of string-bond states as a tool in more traditional machine-learning applications.},

	abstract = {The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is one of the fundamental building blocks of deep learning. RBM finds wide applications in dimensional reduction, feature extraction, and recommender systems via modeling the probability distributions of a variety of input data including natural images, speech signals, and customer ratings, etc. We build a bridge between RBM and tensor network states (TNS) widely used in quantum many-body physics research. We devise efficient algorithms to translate an RBM into the commonly used TNS. Conversely, we give sufficient and necessary conditions to determine whether a TNS can be transformed into an RBM of given architectures. Revealing these general and constructive connections can cross fertilize both deep learning and quantum many-body physics. Notably, by exploiting the entanglement entropy bound of TNS, we can rigorously quantify the expressive power of RBM on complex data sets. Insights into TNS and its entanglement capacity can guide the design of more powerful deep learning architectures. On the other hand, RBM can represent quantum many-body states with fewer parameters compared to TNS, which may allow more efficient classical simulations.},

	abstract = {It is possible to combine multiple latent-variable models of the same data by multiplying their probability distributions together and then renormalizing. This way of combining individual “expert” models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called “contrastive divergence” whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.},
